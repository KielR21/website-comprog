                <h2>I,m Ezekiel A. Reforsado</h2>
                <p>Born on May 4, 2002, Valenzuela City. When I was young, I loved play station games. when I was in grade 1, I moved to Marulas Elementary School until the 2nd quarter of grade 2 because we moved to Lambakin 4A Marilao Bulacan and I continued studying at Lambakin Elementary School Annex. I learned to hang out at the computer shop in grade school so I've almost memorized some games. I graduated from grade 6 here and I transferred to Seed Academy Foundation Incorporated when I entered junior high. I became active in physical activities when I came to junior high so my body was molded here.</p>
